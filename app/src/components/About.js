                        <strong>HTML5</strong> - including Semantic HTML and
                        accessibility considerations.

                      <p>
                        <strong>CSS3</strong> - CSS grid, flexbox and associated
                        frameworks/libraries such as bootstrap, tailwindCSS
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>Javascript</strong> - Basic DOM manipulation,
                        although I am more comfortable using React functional
                        components. Learning Typescript
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>React.js</strong> - Not so much class
                        components, more functional components. Across the
                        common React Hooks such as useState & useEffect. For
                        greater state management, getting across contextAPI.
                        Haven't started on Redux.

                      <p>
                        <strong>Node.js</strong> - for my backend. Across REST
                        APIs and Express so fairly comfortable with my CRUD
                        operations. Getting better with additional middleware
                        such as errorhandling, auth0/jwt. And familiar with some
                        related tools such as postman and insomnia.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>openAPI/Swagger</strong> - Have used it a few
                        times and created the odd yaml file. Still reasonably
                        unfamiliar to me.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>Docker</strong> - I have used Docker Compose as
                        well as Docker Run. Again just haven't created many yaml
                        files but would be confident figuring this out online.
                        No Kubernetes exp.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>Git, Github & VScode</strong> - version control
                        and collaborating tools I'm most familiar with and
                        fairly comfortable on these.

                      <p>
                        <strong>Testing/TDD</strong> - Jest is the main
                        framework I've used, followed by supertest and react
                        testing library. Tiny bit of cypress exposure, no mocha.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>Databases</strong> - Postgres(SQL) and
                        MongoDB(NoSQL) are the two most familiar with me.
                        Haven't played with any other NoSQL ones, a little on
                        the SQL front with Oracle and MYSQL. Postico, Beekeeper
                        Studios and mongoDB Compass are the tools I've used in
                        this space.

                      <p>
                        <strong>Agile DevOps</strong> CI/CD, User Stories,
                        Kanban boards (jira, trello), Scrum, Standups, Retros.
                        These were all common while I was both studying and
                        working with Developers Institute.

                      I have always had an interest in computers, starting from
                      gaming in the 90s on good old dos. Never really thought
                      about computer science much as a career until later in
