            description={`${fbLink} Worked in a platform team on a SaaS project. Involved integrating our organisation onto Okta and syncing up our various apps. A lot of this was learning as we went, so documented everything in confluence and worked in an agile environment with weekly sprints. We also had a help desk type ticketing automation system so students could lodge a support request ticket to us. So I also had a lot of direct contact with students (customers) on a regular basis. Matters such as okta login problems, exercise/project assistance helping them debug code, mental health/anxiety reasons. Quite a challenging but fun role given I am reasonably new to the industry as well. Was also fortunate enough to represent Developers Institute externally at a 1 week hackathon in Whangarei with a client Northpower and AWS reps. Short, somewhat uninformative, video they made of that experience if youâ€™re interested: ${ytLink}`}
