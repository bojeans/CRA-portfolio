              role, as we don't have many clients. If work were to pickup I have
              the ability to be flexible with my schedule/hrs and/or the ability
              to decline jobs. Project I worked on linked below. I worked
              on the frontend of the /trade page and /snipe page. Backend was
              pre-coded in C# by another dev, my role was essentially using
              Swagger for API specs to manage React state between several parent
              & child functional components. A smart search bar, trade history,
              top traded tokens, buy/sell widget were some of the features I
              worked on.

              {fbLink} Worked in a platform team on a SaaS project. Involved
              integrating our organisation onto Okta and syncing up our various
              apps. A lot of this was learning as we went, so documented
              everything in confluence and worked in an agile environment with
              weekly sprints. We also had a help desk type ticketing automation
              system so students could lodge a support request ticket to us. So
              I also had a lot of direct contact with students (customers) on a
              regular basis. Matters such as okta login problems,
              exercise/project assistance helping them debug code, mental
              health/anxiety reasons. Quite a challenging but fun role given I
              am reasonably new to the industry as well. Was also fortunate
              enough to represent Developers Institute externally at a 1 week
              hackathon in Whangarei with a client Northpower and AWS reps.
              Short, somewhat uninformative, video they made of that experience
